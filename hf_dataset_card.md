# Building Energy Benchmarking Dataset

> ⚠️ **Synthetic Data Disclaimer**: This dataset contains **synthetically generated data** for demonstration and testing purposes. It does not represent real buildings or actual energy performance data.

## Overview

Portfolio-level building energy benchmarking data with energy intensity metrics, CO2 emissions, and sustainability ratings. Useful for comparing building performance across different types and locations.

## Schema

```json
{
  "pipeline": "sustainable_building_benchmarking",
  "generated_at": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "portfolio_summary": {
    "total_buildings": 12,
    "total_floor_area_m2": 45680,
    "avg_energy_intensity_kwh_m2": 98.4,
    "portfolio_co2_tons": 892.5,
    "top_performer_pct": 25,
    "needs_improvement_pct": 33
  },
  "benchmark_categories": {
    "energy_intensity": {
      "excellent": "< 70 kWh/m²",
      "good": "70-90 kWh/m²",
      "average": "90-110 kWh/m²",
      "poor": "> 110 kWh/m²"
    }
  },
  "buildings": [
    {
      "building_id": "BLD-001",
      "name": "Main Office Tower",
      "location": "Stockholm",
      "floor_area_m2": 5200,
      "building_type": "Office | Laboratory | Retail | Hotel | Residential",
      "year_built": 2018,
      "energy_intensity_kwh_m2": 72.5,
      "co2_intensity_kg_m2": 16.2,
      "energy_percentile": 15,
      "rating": "Excellent | Good | Average | Poor",
      "certifications": ["LEED Gold", "BREEAM Excellent"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rating Categories

| Rating | Energy Intensity | Description |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Excellent | < 70 kWh/m² | Top 25% performers |
| Good | 70-90 kWh/m² | Above average |
| Average | 90-110 kWh/m² | Typical performance |
| Poor | > 110 kWh/m² | Needs improvement |
